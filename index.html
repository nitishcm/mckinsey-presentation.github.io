# Introduction
 - Migration from on premise to AWS (application, db, deployment scripts, solr, cms)
 - Timeline : 
      - Migration to AWS within 11 months -  Phase 1
      - 2 year total time (Phase 1 - initial migration, Phase 2 - Upgrades and improvements)
- CMS:
      - Work as master slave 
      - Master can only run as single instance
      - Slave to be run along with application in container
- Solr: 
      - Works as slave master
      - Feeds are coming from other internal and external integrations 
-  Webserver :
      - Apache based webserver
      - Common webserver for all the applications
      - The frontend to redirect the incoming call to required application or url
---
      
- Application : 
       - Java base applications
       - Works with CMS as backend
- Version control :
      - Migrating all source code in Github
      - Setting up github flow and PR review for merging
- Konakart : 
     - Ecommerce management tool for each application
     - Database for eCommerce orders and users 
     - Web frontend for tool

# Challenges
      
- Only one instance of CMS master can run as it also has desktop app and web app.
- No support for CMS as it is obselete.
- Containerization of application along with CMS slave, Solr slave. 
- Third party integration coordinations.
- No availability of exact number of requests. No previous firewall present.
- No DevOps pipeline.
- Migration of large databases.
- Setting up Github for all the applications.
- Coordination with stakeholders on changes in URLs to connect to services.
- Migration of Konakart databases and web frontend

# DevOps & other implementations
      
- Implementation of Jenkins pipeline for deployment 
- Jenkins hosted on an EC2 (no support of EFS with ECS at that time)
- Implementation of Lambdas to shut down infra during weekend and start infra on Monday
- AWS configs to manage complaince
