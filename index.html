# Considerations 
- CMS:
      - Work as master slave 
      - Master can only run as single instance
      - Slave to be run along with application in container
- Solr: 
      - Works as slave master
      - Feeds are coming from other internal and external integrations 
-  Webserver :
      - Apache based webserver
      - Common webserver for all the applications
      - The frontend to redirect the incoming call to required application or url
- Application : 
       - Java base applications
       - Works with CMS as backend
