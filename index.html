# Introduction
 - Migration from on premise to AWS (application, db, deployment scripts, solr, cms)
 - Timeline : 
      - Migration to AWS within 11 months
      - 2 year (Phase 1 - initial migration, Phase 2 - Upgrades and improvements)
- CMS:
      - Work as master slave 
      - Master can only run as single instance
      - Slave to be run along with application in container
- Solr: 
      - Works as slave master
      - Feeds are coming from other internal and external integrations 
-  Webserver :
      - Apache based webserver
      - Common webserver for all the applications
      - The frontend to redirect the incoming call to required application or url
- Application : 
       - Java base applications
       - Works with CMS as backend
- Version control :
      - Migrating all source code in Github
---
# Challenges
      
- Only one instance of CMS master can run as it also has desktop app and web app
- No support for CMS as it is obselete
- Containerization of application along with CMS slave, Solr slave. 
- Third party integration coordinations
- No availability of exact number of requests. No previous firewall present.
- No DevOps pipeline
- Migration of large databases
- Setting up Github for all the applications
- Coordination with stakeholders on changes in URLs to connect to services
